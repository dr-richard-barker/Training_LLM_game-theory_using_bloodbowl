# Playing Blood Bowl with Unusual Halfling Mounts:

&#x20;Here's a summary of how your unique Halfling players with animal mounts would interact with the core mechanics:

**Movement:**

* **Mounts affect movement:** Your Halfling players move according to their own speed stat, but their mounts can modify this. For example, Pip's lema increases his movement, Hamfast's hippo makes him slower and the duck allows Barnabas to fly almost anyware on the field.
* **Mounts require activation:** Mounts act as separate entities that you need to activate and move each turn. They can perform basic actions like walking, but their specific abilities might differ. Discuss the probabilty of the hippo going bazerka, the lema jumping other the opposition linesmen, the geese laying a easter egg or hot air balloon sprinjng a leak?!
* **Terrain interaction:** Consider how mounts navigate obstacles. Can the lema jump over rocks? Can the hippo wade through water? what about going near the oppositions end zone.

**Dice Rolling:**

* **Actions require rolls:** When your Halfling or their mount attempts an action (moving, dodging, blocking, etc.), you roll dice to determine success. The game usually uses D6 dice, but if you have alternatives such as a 10 or 12 sided dice then feel free to incorporate but make sure you dicuss the probability requirements with your opposition.
* **Attribute modifiers:** Your player's relevant stat (Strength, Agility, etc.) and any applicable skills modify the dice roll, making success more or less likely (see tables below for examples)
* **Mount assistance:** Some mounts may offer bonuses to certain rolls. Maybe the duck or lema helps with catches, the hippo adds power to blocks, and/or the balloon can fly over opposition.

**Decision-Making:**

* **Evaluate options:** Consider your player's stats, opponent positions, and available actions before rolling the dice (this is the core principle of the game).
* **Risk vs. reward:** Some actions, like blitzing, offer high rewards but carry higher risks of failure.
* **Think creatively:** How can you utilize your unusual mounts to gain an advantage? Can the lema outmaneuver opponents? Can the hippo create blocking opportunities?

**Tables for Probability and Dice Values:**

Unfortunately, Blood Bowl doesn't use simple probabilities for actions. The outcome depends on several factors and potential modifiers (creativity and story telling are key here):

* **Dice type:** Different actions use different dice (D6, D8, etc.), each with their own number of success symbols.
* **Attribute modifiers:** Your player's stats add or subtract from the target number needed for success.
* **Skills:** Specific skills can further modify the target number or re-roll dice, adding layers of complexity.

Therefore, **a single table won't encompass all situations**. However, the Blood Bowl rulebook provides detailed information on:

* **Dice types and target numbers for each action:** This lets you calculate the base chance of success.
* **Attribute modifiers and skill effects:** These tables show how they impact the target number.
* **Specific rules for mounts:** The rulebook might have individual rules for unusual mounts like hippos or lemas.

Remember, Blood Bowl is about adaptation and strategy. Use the core mechanics, your imagination, and these guidelines to create memorable moments with your unique Halfling players and their animal companions!

### Playing Your Unusual Halfling Mount Team: Example Situations

While specific probabilities cannot be easily presented due to Blood Bowl's variable mechanics, here are 3 example tables outlining potential situations faced by your unusual Halfling players:

**Situation 1: Attack (Pip "Galloping" Pipkington blitzing an opponent)**

<table><thead><tr><th width="133">Action</th><th>Attribute Used</th><th>Modifier</th><th>Base Target Number</th><th>Dice</th><th>Additional Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Blitz</td><td>Agility</td><td>+1 (Lema mount)</td><td>4</td><td>2D6</td><td>Lema grants Pip +1 Agility, reducing target number.</td></tr><tr><td>Dodge (opponent)</td><td>Agility</td><td>-1 (blitzing penalty)</td><td>3</td><td>1D6</td><td>Opponent has -1 Agility due to being blitzed.</td></tr></tbody></table>

**Success Outcome:** If Pip rolls 8 or higher (2+6) on his 2D6, his blitz attack hits the opponent. If the opponent also rolls a 3 or higher on their 1D6 dodge roll, they successfully dodge the attack.

**Situation 2: Throw (Beatrice "Beaky" Bumblefoot throwing to a teammate)**

<table><thead><tr><th width="154">Action</th><th>Attribute Used</th><th>Modifier</th><th>Base Target Number</th><th>Dice</th><th>Additional Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Short Pass</td><td>Agility</td><td>+1 (Duck mount)</td><td>5</td><td>1D6</td><td>Duck grants Beatrice +1 Agility, reducing target number.</td></tr><tr><td>Catch (teammate)</td><td>Agility</td><td>-1 (defender marker)</td><td>3</td><td>1D6</td><td>Teammate has -1 Agility due to defender marker.</td></tr></tbody></table>

**Success Outcome:** If Beatrice rolls a 4 or higher on her 1D6, the pass is successful. If the teammate also rolls a 3 or higher on their 1D6 catch roll, they successfully catch the ball.

**Situation 3: Catch (Hamfast "Mudstomper" Mudfoot with "Going for It")**

<table><thead><tr><th width="134">Action</th><th>Attribute Used</th><th>Modifier</th><th>Base Target Number</th><th>Dice</th><th>Additional Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Catch</td><td>Agility</td><td>-2 ("Going for It")</td><td>2</td><td>1D6</td><td>"Going for It" gives +1 action but -2 Agility.</td></tr><tr><td>Pass (opponent)</td><td>Agility</td><td>+0</td><td>4</td><td>1D6</td><td>No modifiers for opponent's pass.</td></tr></tbody></table>

**Success Outcome:** If Hamfast rolls a 2 or higher on his 1D6 (assisted by his hippo?), the catch is successful. However, "Going for It" also gives the opponent a chance to intercept the ball with a successful 4+ roll on their 1D6.

**Remember:** These are just examples, and the actual chances of success depend on specific modifiers, skills, and dice rolls. Consult the Blood Bowl rulebook for detailed information on actions, dice mechanics, and specific mount rules. Most importantly, have fun experimenting with your unique Halfling players and their unusual mounts!
