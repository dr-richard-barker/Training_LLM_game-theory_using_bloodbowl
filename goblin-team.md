&#x20;The MadTown Green Goobers

\


The group of misfits may lack integilance but they make up for it with weapons, equipment, and Ogre power! Although itâ€™s no supplies these little greenies always fine ways to bend the rules and use their sneaky tactics to score or blow something up in the process. They have bombers, squigs, chainsaw fanatics and the occasional black orc can be seen in their ranks as a star player. One of the great strengths of the goblins is their small size which often leads to them being thrown long distance and have even been know to acheive the occasional interception in the way.
