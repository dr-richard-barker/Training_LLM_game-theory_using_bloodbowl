# Training how to use game theory using the Warhammer game known as "Blood Bowl"

### This site is designed to help you visualise a blood ball game between a halfling and undead team (& a few other teams to provide the context of the rest of the league)

Planning and visualising a Blood Bowl game between a Halfling and Undead team involves understanding the key characteristics and strategies of both teams, as well as creating a vivid image of the clash on the pitch. Here's how we can break it down:

## Understanding the Teams (life vs death)

Halfling Team: Known for their agility and surprising resilience, Halflings are underdogs in Blood Bowl. They rely on their Treemen to provide muscle and throwing capability, while the Halflings themselves excel at dodging and unexpected plays. Their game strategy often involves avoiding direct confrontations and using their mobility to outmanoeuvre opponents. Undead Team: The Undead bring a mix of speed (from Ghouls and Wights) and brute strength (from Mummies). Thanks to Regeneration and a generally sturdy lineup, they can absorb punishment and keep coming. Their strategy can be more straightforward, using their strength and resilience to dominate the field and control the ball with their faster units.

**Planning the Game** Setting: The game takes place in a classic Blood Bowl stadium, adorned with fans of both teams. The atmosphere is electric, with Halfling fans cooking up a feast in the stands, and Undead fans... eerily silent.

**Kickoff:** The Halflings will aim to use their Treemen to secure the ball and make quick passes until the treeman can make enough space to throw a halfling catcher who's holding the ball over the Undead's heavy hitting defensive line. The Undead, on the other hand, will try to use their Mummies to break through the Halfling line and disrupt their play.

**Mid-Game:** Halflings will need to exploit any gaps they can find, using their agility to slip through Undead lines. The Undead will focus on controlling the pitch, using their Ghouls to chase down the ball and Wights to block Halfling movements.

**Endgame:** If the Halflings manage to stay clear of the Undead's grasp, they could pull off a surprise win with a swift touchdown. The Undead team will rely on grinding down the Halflings and securing the ball for a slow, relentless advance towards the Halfling end zone.

**Visualising the Game** Imagine a scene where a Halfling player is attempting a daring dodge around a Wight, ball in hand, aiming for a clear path to the end zone. In the background, a Treeman is engaged with a Mummy, fans from both sides are on their feet, and the rest of the players are positioned in a dynamic and tense formation, reflecting the critical moment of the game. This image captures the intensity and dynamics of the match, with key players in action and fans from both sides fully engaged in the spectacle. Use this visualization to enhance your planning and execution of the game, imagining the strategies and movements that could lead to victory or defeat for either side.

**Below:** tables for "special moves" and "cool traits" and a column summarizing dice roll interaction and changes in probability that helps to quantify their effects on gameplay, making it clearer how each move or trait influences the game's mechanics:

#### Special Moves Table

| Special Move    | Description                                       | Dice Role Interaction and Probability Change                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dodge           | Increases evasion ability                         | Allows re-roll of failed dodge attempts                                                        |
| Throw Team-Mate | Enables throwing smaller players across the field | Success based on strength check; failure can result in player landing mishap                   |
| Block           | Improves resistance to being knocked down         | Adds a re-roll or favorable modifier to block attempts                                         |
| Pass            | Enhances throw accuracy                           | Adds a bonus to pass attempts, reducing failure chance                                         |
| Catch           | Improves likelihood of catching the ball          | Provides re-roll or bonus for catch attempts                                                   |
| Sure Hands      | Reduces fumbling on pickups                       | Negates the need for a re-roll on pickup failures; may automatically succeed on a certain roll |
| Mighty Blow     | Increases chance of injuring an opponent          | Adds a modifier to injury rolls, increasing severity of outcomes                               |
| Regeneration    | Allows recovery from injuries                     | On injury, roll a die; on a successful roll, the player may return to the game                 |
| Sprint          | Extends movement range                            | Allows additional movement beyond normal limit, no extra dice roll required                    |
| Side Step       | Player chooses where they are pushed back to      | Affects positioning without a direct dice roll but alters opponent's pushback options          |

#### Cool Traits Table

<table><thead><tr><th width="179">Cool Trait</th><th width="191">Description</th><th>Dice Role Interaction and Probability Change</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Unbelievable Luck</td><td>Allows re-rolling unfavorable outcomes</td><td>Grants one re-roll per game or reduces penalty in specific situations</td></tr><tr><td>Expert at Sneaking Past Defenses</td><td>Increased chance to bypass tackle zones</td><td>Modifies or negates opponent's tackle zone effects for one action</td></tr><tr><td>Master Tactician</td><td>Provides team-wide bonus or strategic options</td><td>May allow a strategic play once per game that ignores or modifies normal rule constraints</td></tr><tr><td>Fearsome Presence</td><td>Reduces effectiveness of nearby opponents</td><td>Opponents within a certain radius may have a penalty on their actions</td></tr><tr><td>Can Cook a Mean Stew Mid-Game</td><td>Boosts team morale</td><td>Temporarily improves team stats or recovery rates, possibly through a morale roll</td></tr><tr><td>Intimidating Presence</td><td>Increases chance of opponents failing actions</td><td>Opponents have a penalty on actions or must re-roll successful actions within a certain radius</td></tr></tbody></table>

These tables synthesize the game's mechanics, offering clear insights into how each special move and cool trait directly impacts the outcomes of actions through dice rolls and probability changes. This structured approach not only aids in understanding and balancing gameplay but also enriches the strategic depth available to players.
