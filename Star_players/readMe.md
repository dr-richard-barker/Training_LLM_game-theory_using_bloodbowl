This table provides a structured overview of Halfling star players with unusual mounts, outlining their species, skills, cool traits, animal mounts, and key attributes such as speed, agility, strength, toughness, defence type, and primary role in the game. Pip's speed is boosted by his lema mount, making him a fast blitzer. Beatrice's duck mount provides some agility but is relatively fragile. Hamfast relies on his hippo's strength and bulk for his defence. Barnabas' hot air balloon grants him unique mobility and aerial advantages.
