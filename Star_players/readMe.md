**Additional notes**

Pip's speed is boosted by his lema mount, making him a fast blitzer.
Beatrice's duck mount provides some agility but is relatively fragile.
Hamfast relies on his hippo's strength and bulk for his defence.
Barnabas' hot air balloon grants him unique mobility and aerial advantages.
