# Wood Elf team

Wood Elf teams are renowned for their exceptional speed and agility, enabling them to execute swift and agile maneuvers effectively. This ability positions them to outperform and outmaneuver opposing teams with relative ease. However, their comparative lack of strength and toughness renders them susceptible to more physically dominant teams. To mitigate this vulnerability, Wood Elf teams leverage their superior mobility and ball-handling skills.
