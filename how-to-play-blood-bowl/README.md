# How to play blood bowl

## **To prepare a game of Blood Bowl, follow these steps:**

1. Choose your team: Select a team that suits your playstyle. For beginners, the Undead team is recommended as they have a well-rounded setup with clearly defined roles for each player.
2. Familiarize yourself with the rules: While not overly complex, it's essential to understand the basic ruleset before playing.
3. Study your opponent: Before making any moves, inspect the enemy players and read their skills to avoid surprises.
4. Plan your strategy: Decide whether you'll focus on offense or defense based on your team's strengths and the opponent's weaknesses.
5. Understand game management: Learn about turn management and score management to achieve the best possible result in the game.
6. Set up the game: Prepare the playing field, arrange your team, and ensure all necessary components are ready.
7. Consider playing a simplified version: For introducing new players, you might want to start with Blood Bowl Sevens, a faster version of the game with fewer players.
8. Be prepared to adapt: Blood Bowl is unpredictable, so be ready to assess the game state continuously and change your plans if necessary.

Remember, Blood Bowl is a game that combines strategy, tactics, and luck. As you play more games, you'll gain experience and develop better strategies for your chosen team.



### Stages and Mechanics of the Start of the Game

1. **Pre-Game Setup**:
   * **Team Selection**: Each coach selects their team and sets up the game board, placing their Dugout, Turn Counter, Score Counter, and Re-roll Counters.
   * **Weather Roll**: The weather is typically determined during the pre-game sequence by rolling two D6 dice and consulting the Weather table. This means that both coaches know the weather conditions before setting up their teams, allowing them to adjust their initial strategies accordingly.
     *   Weather can have a significant impact on the first turn and overall gameplay in Blood Bowl. Here's how different weather conditions affect the start of the game:

         1. Perfect Conditions (most common result):No special effects. The game proceeds normally.
         2. Pouring Rain: Applies a -1 modifier to all Agility tests for catching, picking up, or interfering with passes. Makes the ball very slippery, affecting ball handling from the start.
         3. Very Sunny: Imposes a -1 modifier on all passing rolls due to glare. This can affect the receiving team's ability to make accurate passes on their first turn.
         4. Blizzard: Applies a -1 modifier when players attempt to Rush (move an extra square). Limits passing options to only Quick and Short passes due to poor visibility. These effects can significantly impact movement and passing strategies for the receiving team.
         5. Sweltering Heat: At the end of a drive, there's a chance that players may collapse from heat exhaustion. While this doesn't directly affect the first turn, teams need to consider potential player losses for subsequent drives.&#x20;
         6. Other weather conditions: Depending on the ruleset or variations used, there might be additional weather effects like strong winds or misty conditions that can alter ball deviation or limit player movement (discuss with players what this will be in this game instance/stadium).

2. **Starting the Game**:
   * **Coin Toss**: Flip a coin or roll a die to decide which coach sets up first. The winning coach chooses whether to set up first or second.
   * **Team Setup**: Each coach sets up 11 players between their End Zone and the Midfield Stripe, adhering to specific setup rules.
   * **Kick-off Table**: The coach of the kicking team rolls two dice and consults the Kick-off Table to determine any special events that occur before the kick-off.
3. **Kick-off**:
   * **Placing the Ball**: The kicking team places the ball in any square in the opponent's half of the field. The ball then scatters in a random direction determined by rolling an eight-sided die and a d6 for the number of squares.
   * **Touchback**: If the ball scatters off the field or into the kicking team's half, the receiving coach gets a 'touchback' and can give the ball to any player on their team.

### First Turn Mechanics

1. **Receiving Team's Turn**:
   * The receiving team starts their turn by attempting to pick up the ball if it is not already in possession.
   * Players can move, block, pass, or perform other actions according to the game's rules.
2. **Turn Sequence**:
   * Each coach alternates turns, with each turn consisting of moving players, performing actions, and resolving any events that occur.

### Additional Notes

* **Game Duration**: Blood Bowl is played in two halves, each consisting of eight turns per coach.
* **Unpredictable Events**: The Kick-off Table introduces random events that can significantly impact the game.
