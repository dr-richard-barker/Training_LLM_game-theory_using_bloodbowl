Adding small, thematic elements to your Halfling models can really bring them to life and enhance the fun aspect of your Blood Bowl team. Here are some creative additions to consider:

1. **Cooking Utensils:** Small bits like tiny spoons, forks, or even a miniature cooking pot can hint at the Halflings' love for food. These could be attached to their belts or backs as if they're ready to cook up a feast anytime.
2. **Food Items:** Crafting tiny food items like pies, sausages, or a loaf of bread to place either in their hands or tucked into their gear can add a whimsical touch. You might even position a model as if throwing a pie instead of a ball.
3. **Pouches and Sacks:** Adding small pouches or sacks, possibly filled with grain or vegetables, can emphasize their rural background. These can be painted in earthy tones to complement their overall color scheme.
4. **Ale Mugs:** A tiny mug or tankard attached to the model’s belt or held in a hand can suggest that the Halfling is ready for a post-game celebration, reinforcing the team's jovial nature.
5. **Animal Companions:** Halflings are often depicted alongside animals. Small birds, dogs, or even a tiny pig could be added to bases to show this companionship. A model could also be sculpted or modified to be riding a dog, for instance.
6. **Fishing Gear:** Since Halflings are known to enjoy simple pleasures, a bit of fishing gear like a tiny rod or a fish dangling from their pack could suggest their hobbies outside of Blood Bowl.
7. **Floral and Foliage Decorations:** Adding tiny flowers or leaves to the bases or even woven into their hair/beards can emphasize their connection to nature. This can also add pops of color to your models.
8. **Sports Gear:** Beyond the standard Blood Bowl equipment, consider humorous additions like a whistle around a neck, a playbook under an arm, or overly large protective gear that looks comically inadequate.
9. **Banners or Flags:** Tiny banners or flags representing their team, attached to their back or the base, can add a sense of pride and belonging. These could be in your team’s colors or feature a small emblem or mascot.
10. **Magical Trinkets:** To hint at the mystical side of Blood Bowl, small, magical-looking trinkets, crystals, or scrolls could suggest the hidden depths of Halfling strategy or their reliance on luck and magic.

When adding these elements, consider the scale and how they will fit with the overall theme and balance of your model. Small additions should enhance the model's story without overwhelming it. Using super glue or hobby glue will ensure these tiny details stay in place. Always remember, the goal is to add personality and narrative to your team, making them uniquely yours.
